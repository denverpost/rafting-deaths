	        <p>Melissa and Dan Durkee reached Big Drop Rapid near midnight, the roar of the Arkansas River filling their ears as they peered over the edge.</p>
			<p>When their flashlight rays gleamed upon the river, churning with rage and spitting out whitewater as it pumped through the rocky canyon, Melissa&rsquo;s stomach lurched, again. She wondered, this time with more sickening fear than ever, if there was any chance her son was still alive.</p>

			<p>They had walked 7 miles down railroad tracks, led by the rafting company owner, to reach the spot in Brown&rsquo;s Canyon where 11-year-old Drake had fallen into the river hours earlier on June 10, 2015. Drake had been on a commercial trip booked while on a summer getaway with his grandparents and his brother. Melissa said OK because she thought it was a scenic float, not the turbulent whitewater now below her.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Drake!,&rdquo; his parents called into the darkness, hoping against the odds that their son had saved himself and was now somewhere in the desert scrub brush and juniper along the riverbank. He had been tossed out of the raft into the murky, pulsing water and had not been seen since.</p>
			<p>At 2 a.m., they built a campfire on the bank, and Melissa sat down, tugged her sweatshirt over her face and ears, and tried to drown out the noise of the raging water. The sound was making her physically sick.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is where he is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Melissa slept briefly with her sweatshirt over her head, curled up on the ground. Her husband and father walked some 20 miles, downstream and back, with their flashlights. Dan Durkee, fire chief for the Platteville-Gilcrest Fire Protection District, would walk for the next two days, nearly 30 miles each day, searching for his youngest child while Melissa organized search parties and comforted their three older children in a Buena Vista motel room.</p>
			<p>Dan was there, surrounded by his firefighters, when rescuers pulled his son&rsquo;s body out of the Arkansas. Drake&rsquo;s foot was snagged at the bottom of the river, his body trapped by an undercut rock chiseled away by the power of the water.</p>
			<p>The spot was in the same place where Melissa had dropped to the ground along the riverbank that first night and refused to move.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Seeking a beginner trip</h3>

			<p>Melissa&rsquo;s parents drove from their home in South Dakota to spend a week in the Colorado mountains with grandsons Drake, 11, and Dawson, 15.</p>
			<p>After picking up the boys at home in Golden, the four camped in Gunnison, swam in hot springs and went fishing on a pontoon boat. At their KOA campground, Drake cooked up the day&rsquo;s catch for dinner.</p>
			<p>They had planned to spend that Wednesday at a hot springs in Salida. But when they arrived, the indoor pool was closed to the public for a private party. Instead, they found a kiosk of brochures, and the boys began looking at rafting trips.</p>
			<p>Their grandpa Steve Feeldy selected a brochure for the Adventure Company because it advertised the &ldquo;best safety equipment&rdquo; and the most experienced guides, all with at least four years of experience. Feeldy wanted the beginner trip, a scenic float. But when they called the Adventure Company &mdash; on speaker phone in the car &mdash; the employee suggested they take the intermediate, afternoon trip down Brown&rsquo;s Canyon, even though Feeldy told the woman he didn&rsquo;t know how to swim and that Drake was not a strong swimmer, Feeldy said.</p>
			<p>He was reassured multiple times &mdash; on the phone and at the Adventure Company — that people &ldquo;50 pounds to age 80&rdquo; float the intermediate-level trip, which included Class III-IV rapids. The international rapids rating scale describes Class III rapids as &ldquo;large waves, obstacles and narrow passages.&rdquo; On that day in June, the water was fast and high, with the flow gauge in Nathrop recording 3,080 cubic feet per second.</p>
			<p>The boys played with a puzzle while their grandpa signed waivers and reminded the guides he and Drake were not swimmers. Their grandmother planned to wait in the car during the scheduled three-hour trip, using her iPad.</p>
			<p>The boys were excited. Feeldy was nervous.</p>
			<p>During the safety talk along the shore, a guide used Drake as a model, grabbing him by the straps of his life jacket and leaning backward to demonstrate how to pull someone back into the boat should they fall into the river.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Where is Drake?</h3>

			<p>The raft carrying Drake, Dawson and their grandpa was light, riding high enough they were paddling air, not water, Dawson and his grandfather would say later.</p>
			<p>They were the only three people in the boat, besides their guide, who sat in the center with two oars. The rafts weren&rsquo;t reorganized to distribute weight evenly, in part because others who had signed up for the trip wanted to stick together.</p>
			<p>Guide Tim McDonald wasn&rsquo;t working that day but borrowed a raft from the Adventure Company and joined the four-boat trip to take his teenage son Tristan and a few of his friends down the river as a graduation present. He posted on Facebook just before the trip: &ldquo;Stressful, as I&rsquo;ll have all these young folks under my care, and Tristan is the only one who&rsquo;s seen such high flows.&rdquo; McDonald told his passengers the boat carrying Drake was light, and he wanted to stay close to it, according to a Colorado Parks and Wildlife investigation.</p>
			<p>McDonald, 48, had more rafting experience than any other guide on the trip. The guide of Drake&rsquo;s boat, Kristen Vetter, 34, a nurse, had several years of experience on various rivers but was on her fifth trip for the Adventure Company.</p>
			<p>Their boat was third in line as it entered Big Drop Rapid, which begins at a right-hand bend in the Arkansas. It&rsquo;s a series of complex currents, a sharp left-hand turn against broken rock wall and a large, crushing wave on the left side of the river.</p>
			<p>The first two rafts, which included McDonald&rsquo;s, stuck to the right, avoiding the left-side wave &mdash; the standard line for commercial trips when water flow reached more than 2,500 cubic feet per second, which it had that week.</p>
			<p>But the raft carrying Drake, who had just finished fifth grade, instead went left, turned and hit the rapid with its side instead of the nose. Vetter was shouting at them to paddle hard. McDonald, watching from downstream, yelled &ldquo;Flip!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Swimmers!&rdquo; The raft didn&rsquo;t flip but tipped onto its side, tossing Drake and his grandpa into the river.</p>
			<p>Dawson nearly fell out too but had his foot wedged under the raft tube.</p>
			<p>The raft surfed briefly in place, held by the suck of the wave. Dawson saw his little brother bobbing in the water, nearing the right riverbank, and yelled to him, &ldquo;Swim to shore!&rdquo; His grandfather floated a few yards downstream, struggling for air in the frigid water, and was pulled into one of the other rafts by a passenger.</p>
			<p>When Dawson looked back to find to his brother, Drake was gone.</p>
			<p>Vetter had been guiding their boat toward Feeldy, because she knew he could not swim, until he was pulled into the other raft. &ldquo;Where is Drake?&rdquo; she asked repeatedly. She had seen Drake closer to another raft and hoped that boat had rescued him, according to the state parks report.</p>
			<p>The last of the four rafts on the trip floated near the spot where Dawson had last seen his brother, and a passenger in that boat shouted that he saw an arm &mdash; grasping for something &mdash; come out of the water. &ldquo;Their boat floated over the arm,&rdquo; according to the report.</p>
			<p>The guide in that boat, Patrick Brown, did not see an arm and told his passenger that Drake was surely much farther downstream; the water was moving too fast.</p>
			<p>All four rafts pulled over on the right side of the river. &ldquo;The guides then realized that Drake was unaccounted for,&rdquo; according to the report, and began a frantic search. One guide crossed the river to search the opposite bank while the rest ran up and down the west side, closest to where Drake was last seen.</p>
			<p>The guides had no radio or phone reception in the canyon, according to the state report.</p>
			<p>When a raft trip from another company floated by about 20 minutes later, the Adventure Company guides shouted to those guides to radio for help as soon as they had a signal.</p>
			<p>They set up a &ldquo;live bait&rdquo; rescue, a dangerous exercise where a rescuer swims the river in a life vest clipped to a rope, which is held by people on shore who are ready to pull the rescuer, and a victim, out of the water.</p>
			<p>McDonald, in the river clipped to the rope, made several attempts to find Drake.</p>
			<p>About 15 minutes after Drake had gone missing, his empty life jacket surfaced downstream and was captured by McDonald.</p>
			<p>Guides from the other rafting company radioed the owner of the Adventure Company, who called authorities at about 3:30 p.m. The exact time Drake fell from the raft is not known, but reports estimate the call came 20 to 40 minutes minutes later.</p>
			<p>Two rangers from the Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area launched a raft at Ruby Mountain, about 5 miles upstream from Big Drop Rapid, taking turns rowing until they reached the eddy below Big Drop. They walked the banks, searching for Drake in spots where the river flow could trap a person floating downstream. The current was &ldquo;extremely powerful and moving fast, creating dangerous situations for us during our search,&rdquo; their report says.</p>
			<p>Chaffee County searchers, meanwhile, arrived by ATVs, scanning the river as they drove upstream.</p>
			<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies and river rangers reported that Adventure Company guides, including the one navigating Drake&rsquo;s raft, refused to give interviews, because they were too emotional and because their boss, Mark Hammer, advised them to take 24 hours to decide whether they wanted to talk, according to the state investigation and a sheriff&rsquo;s report. Only one of the teenagers in McDonald&rsquo;s raft agreed to talk to sheriff&rsquo;s investigators that day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to help a little boy,&rdquo; the girl said. The lack of cooperation meant search teams &ldquo;had very little details to go off of,&rdquo; the state parks report says.</p>
			<p>Hammer disputes this, saying he told authorities multiple times where Drake fell out and that the boy was missing within about 8 seconds. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they didn&rsquo;t know where to find him,&rdquo; Hammer said on a recent June day outside his rafting company near Buena Vista. &ldquo;The boats were in position to scoop him up, but he never came up.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Dawson and his grandfather refused to get back in the raft to finish the trip.</p>
			<p>Instead, they followed railroad tracks 3 miles to Hecla Junction, the scheduled take-out point.</p>
			<p>At dark that first day, the search was suspended until the next morning.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">The worst moment</h3>

			<p>Dan Durkee had just finished a workout with his oldest daughter, and they were at On the Border when his father-in-law called. &ldquo;I never wanted to make this phone call,&rdquo; he started.</p>
			<p>Feeldy told him they had gone rafting and that Drake had fallen out, that they couldn&rsquo;t find him. Dan doesn&rsquo;t remember the whole conversation clearly but he remembers asking how long Drake had been missing. The answer devastated him. &ldquo;About three hours,&rdquo; his father-in-law choked. Dan calls it the &ldquo;first worst moment of his life.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Then Dan had to call Melissa.</p>
			<p>She had just pulled up to the Denver Public Library near downtown to meet a friend for a book sale and dinner. Melissa could barely understand him. She heard him say they couldn&rsquo;t find Drake but they had found his life jacket.</p>
			<p>Melissa sped home in rush-hour traffic, screaming and crying. She was there in 20 minutes.</p>
			<p>She got out of her car and threw up in her front yard.</p>
			<p>On the two-hour drive down U.S. 285, the Durkees prayed out loud, wishing for the phone to ring with news Drake had been found. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; Melissa kept saying. &ldquo;He never gives up.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It was true, Drake was a standout at most everything he tried, a 100-pound fifth-grader with so much heart he inspired his teammates to push themselves to a basketball championship the first season any of them had ever played. Football was his game &mdash; two weeks after he died his parents received a letter from a national scouting organization saying he was one of 25 kids in the country selected to play in an all-American bowl game. Drake played basketball because his dad had played and he wanted to learn. &ldquo;We started practicing, and we were terrible,&rdquo; said Dan, a rare smile quickly passing across his pained face. &ldquo;But Drake would play every day like it was the seventh game of the NBA Finals.&rdquo; They won the championship 14-13, pouring on the defense because none of them could shoot.</p>
			<p>Drake sang in the choir and got good grades at Maple Grove Elementary, and his classmates chose him to represent them at the state Capitol by giving the Pledge of Allegiance. The Durkees&rsquo; lives revolved around getting Drake to activities. Dan was his coach.</p>
			<p>While Dan and Melissa were driving to Buena Vista, the rafting company owner and his wife drove Dawson and his grandfather back to the company&rsquo;s rustic building, where smiling pictures of rafters in whitewater flash on a television screen in the lobby, and where the boys&rsquo; grandmother was waiting in her car. When Kathy Feeldy saw them get of the car without Drake, she knew something terrible had happened.</p>
			<p>She cried and she screamed. &ldquo;How could you let this happen?&rdquo; she shouted at Hammer, the owner. &ldquo;You promised us they would be safe!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Dawson sat on a bench outside the rafting company and cried.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">A shift in the search</h3>

			<p>Melissa gave searchers Drake&rsquo;s sweatpants, so their dog team could track his scent.</p>
			<p>The day after Drake fell into the river, authorities &mdash; plus 10 of Dan&rsquo;s firefighters who rented ATVs &mdash; searched the river and its banks as far as 26 miles downstream to Rincon Recreation Site in Fremont County.</p>
			<p>Nothing, for the second day in a row, despite underwater cameras and poles that probed near giant boulders and other entrapments downstream of Big Drop.</p>
			<p>Then on the third day, one of the guides who hadn&rsquo;t talked to authorities the day of the accident called Chaffee County officials to say he had been downstream from Drake and there was no way the boy had floated past him. The information from guide Chris Williams caused rescuers to move their search 150 yards upstream, not far from where the 11-year-old had fallen overboard.</p>
			<p>Soon after, a state parks ranger found what he thought was Drake during an underwater camera probe.</p>
			<p>He hooked and pulled off Drake&rsquo;s blue rafting helmet.</p>
			<p>Drake was hung up on rocks 2 or 3 feet underwater, about 3 to 6 feet from shore, in &ldquo;extremely swift current,&rdquo; the state report says.</p>
			<p>Rescuers used a rope to pull Drake upstream, which freed his foot from the rocks. As they worked to gently lift Drake&rsquo;s body out of the water, they tried to shield him from rafters who whooped and cheered as they bounced down the Arkansas, one of the most heavily commercially rafted rivers in America.</p>
			<p>Dan&rsquo;s firefighters told him to step away, but he couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;That was the next worst moment of my life,&rdquo; he said. Until then, he had held out hope. &ldquo;If there was a one-in-a-million chance that he was alive, I was going to find him,&rdquo; Dan said.</p>
			<p>When his son&rsquo;s body was out of the river, Dan took off on an ATV to find Melissa and his three other children in Buena Vista. He ran into his father-in-law on the railroad tracks. Feeldy collapsed when Dan told him.</p>
			<p>The Adventure Company, which has been ticketed a few times in recent years for failure to maintain guide records and for having unqualified guides, received a citation after Drake&rsquo;s death because one guide had received CPR training online instead of in person. Company owner Hammer and others argued that state regulations did not specify that online training did not count, a regulation that was rewritten this year to make it clear river guides need in-person instruction.</p>
			<p>There are no state regulations that stipulate the appropriate age for intermediate or expert rafting trips, or age limits when water flow is high, or when rafts are loaded too lightly. No law requires rafting guides to have radio or satellite phone communication &mdash; although that might not matter because reception is spotty in remote canyon stretches.</p>
			<p>The Durkees want Colorado policymakers to re-examine rafting regulations, which they believe are too weak. They have sued the Adventure Company, Hammer and his guides in a case that is ongoing and that the Durkees hope will have lasting effects on Colorado&rsquo;s $163 million rafting industry. Melissa and Dan were inflamed to hear that the four years of guiding experience advertised in the company&rsquo;s brochure doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean in rafting &mdash; zip-line and other sports count, according to the company owner&rsquo;s deposition. The Durkees&rsquo; lawyers at Jordan &amp; Associates declined to comment for this story.</p>
			<p>Hammer, who has been a river guide for 29 years, said his guides were &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; by what happened, but he would not say whether they are still guiding. He understands why the Durkees are angry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sad and sympathetic or them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Being a father, I can only imagine how they feel.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>But, he says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what could have changed this. People fall out of rafts occasionally in this industry. There is no way to change what happened. They are hurting so badly; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to them.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Drake was sucked under an undercut rock and trapped within seconds of falling out of the boat. Customers are warned during the pre-float safety talk not to stand up in the river, he said.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s why people who book rafting trips must sign a waiver acknowledging the &ldquo;inherent risk&rdquo; of going out on the river.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Broken</h3>

			<p>On a hot day in May, tears slipped out from under Melissa&rsquo;s sunglasses as Drake&rsquo;s classmates gathered on the school playground for the first glimpse at a &ldquo;buddy bench&rdquo; with his name on it.</p>
			<p>Many of them wore orange Broncos jerseys with No. 88, for Demaryius Thomas, Drake&rsquo;s favorite player. The choir sang the Beatles&rsquo; &ldquo;Blackbird,&rdquo; and the teachers cried.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He had a way of making you feel welcome,&rdquo; Maple Grove Elementary principal Ian Stone said. &ldquo;He had a way of just being a kind soul. I&rsquo;m not even sure he knew how special he was.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Dan told the children, &ldquo;Keep him in your hearts. Can you do that for me?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Afterward, Melissa and Dan were surrounded in a grassy field behind the school by sixth-graders who wrapped them in bear hugs.</p>
			<p>The Durkees say their family is broken now.</p>
			<p>None of them wants to go near water. One of their daughters had a panic attack while taking a bath. Dan hasn&rsquo;t slept longer than two or three hours at a time in a year.</p>
			<p>Their relationship with Melissa&rsquo;s parents is changed &mdash; they love each other, but they don&rsquo;t talk as much as they used to because they don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;make each other sad.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There is something really daunting that deep in your soul you know you will never again know true happiness,&rdquo; Melissa said.</p>
			<p>At home, Melissa and Dan spend more time alone, while Dawson says he spends more time with his older sisters, who are 23 and 19, than they spend as a family.</p>
			<p>Before the anniversary of Drake&rsquo;s death this week, Melissa passed out notecards with his picture and a message asking people to &ldquo;do an act of kindness for someone&rdquo; on June 10. The family also has created the <a href="http://www.thedrakedurkeefoundation.org/foundation/">Drake Durkee Foundation</a> to give scholarships and awards in his name. &ldquo;My worst fear is people forgetting him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything else.&rdquo;</p>

				<h3><span class="titlepart">Death on the River: Rising flow</span></h3>
				<h2>Third year of high water spotlights dangers of commercial rafting</h2>
				<p class="byline">By Jennifer Brown</p>

			<p>More people were killed during guided rafting trips the past two seasons &mdash; when Colorado rivers pulsed with high water &mdash; than in the previous five years combined.</p>
			<p>Twelve people, seven last year and five in 2014, were victims of deadly commercial rafting trips along the Arkansas River, Clear Creek, the Cache la Poudre, the Roaring Fork and the Animas, a statistic rafting experts blame on rushing, higher-than-average water flow.</p>
			<p>At the start of the third high-water season in a row, river rangers with Colorado Parks and Wildlife warned thrill seekers to check themselves before signing up for major whitewater. <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/05/22/woman-dies-after-falling-from-commercial-raft-on-arkansas-river/">Two people have died</a> on commercial trips this summer on the Arkansas and the <a href="http://www.aspentimes.com/news/22494128-113/breaking-news-man-dies-on-roaring-fork-river">Roaring Fork</a>, and another was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/12/raft-overturns-in-clear-creek-woman-in-critical-condition/">in critical condition</a> last weekend after falling out of a guided raft on Clear Creek.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Disneyland. This is the real deal,&rdquo; said Stew Pappenfort, senior ranger at the Salida-based Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area, which has just five river rangers to watch over 152 miles of water coursing from Leadville through Brown&rsquo;s Canyon and the Royal Gorge. &ldquo;Everything is fine when you are in the boat. Once you are out, it&rsquo;s a whole new game.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Many of the 12 deadly accidents in the past two years, which are detailed in state parks reports and law enforcement documents reviewed by The Denver Post, involved people who were in their 40s and 50s and out of shape. Two had heart problems, according to reports.</p>
			<p>Pappenfort, who has 40 seasons of guide and ranger experience, trains new river guides on how to book customers on trips that suit their abilities, taking into account their rafting experience, whether they know how to swim, their age, weight and general physical health.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A lot of the serious accidents are screening errors, whether it&rsquo;s an error of the passenger or an outfitter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you go to a ski area for the first time, slap on skis, take the lift to the top of a black run, go down and say, &lsquo;I wonder what is going to happen now?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s up to rafting outfitters in this state to set age limits for expert trips or to decide whether to take a customer who has never rafted before and doesn&rsquo;t know how to swim. There is no state law that prohibits a rafting company from taking guests down the river when a high-water advisory is in effect &mdash; only a law officer can shut down a section of a river if, for example, a truck crashes off the bridge and into the river, as happened a couple of years ago along the Poudre River.</p>
			<p>This week, three sections of the Arkansas with serious rapids, including the popular Numbers stretch, were under a high-water advisory. The designation &ldquo;recommends&rdquo; that commercial outfitters alter their runs, putting in or taking out at different points than scheduled. Commercial outfitters heed the warnings &ldquo;pretty well,&rdquo; but private kayakers and rafters who &ldquo;live for these levels&rdquo; often go anyway, Pappenfort said.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">No attempt to self-rescue</h3>

			<p>Commercial rafting companies took more than 500,000 people down Colorado rivers in 2014 and again in 2015, so, statistically speaking, the odds of dying on a commercial rafting trip are a fraction of a percentage. But the risks increase when looking at only expert-level trips, where the rapids are rated at least Class IV &mdash; defined as &ldquo;intense, powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water&rdquo; on the international rating scale.</p>
			<p>All but three of the 12 people who died on guided trips in 2014 and 2015 were on Class IV and V rapids, which make up an estimated one-quarter to one-third of the commercial trips in this state, according to outfitters and Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area statistics. The other three deaths, including an 11-year-old boy from Golden, were on intermediate rapids rated Class III, although the rapid where the boy fell into the Arkansas River, called Big Drop, borders on Class IV depending on water flow.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great activity, but you have to go into it with a definite respect for the river,&rdquo; said Kris Wahlers, boating safety program manager for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. &ldquo;If a passenger falls in the river, they need the presence of mind and ability to try to save themselves. If you think that physical demand may be out of your ability, I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t go rafting, but maybe think about another trip.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The phrase &ldquo;the victim made no attempt to self-rescue&rdquo; appears repeatedly in investigative reports of rafting deaths. Several of the reports also mention a victim was a &ldquo;big person&rdquo; or had trouble squeezing into the wetsuit before the trip. In a handful of cases, the victim was too heavy for other passengers to pull back into the boat. At least one outfitter has a policy that if a guest can&rsquo;t fit into a life jacket, they can&rsquo;t go.</p>
			<p>Private rafting trips, where regulations about guide experience and CPR qualifications do not apply, are not tracked statewide.  Along a stretch of the Arkansas from Leadville to Ca&ntilde;on City, guided boats are about 10-to-1, rangers said.</p>
			<p>Statewide, five people were killed last summer on private river runs &mdash; either by raft, kayak or paddleboard &mdash; and nine were killed on private trips in 2014. In 2012 and 2013, both low-water years when the season was shorter, just one person was killed on a private trip, according to state parks statistics.</p>
			<p>In the past two years, river rangers statewide have written about 40 tickets to rafting outfitters for infractions including failing to maintain guide records or not having a first-aid kit. Tickets are $50.</p>
			<p>Andrew Maddox, river ranger supervisor at Arkansas Headwaters, and his four rangers typically start their days checking commercial rafts for the required safety equipment at popular put-ins near Buena Vista and Ca&ntilde;on City. Then they head downstream by raft or kayak and &ldquo;post up&rdquo; near Sunshine Rapid along the Royal Gorge trip or at Raft Ripper or Seidel&rsquo;s Suckhole along the Brown&rsquo;s Canyon trip. They wait along the shore or in eddies, ready to scoop up people and paddles that fall overboard.</p>
			<p>In a season, they pluck about 100 people from the river or pull them to shore by rope, Maddox said.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Remote rivers, no phone reception</h3>

			<p>Colorado has about 200 river outfitters &mdash; including whitewater adventure tours and more peaceful float-fishing trips &mdash; licensed by the state, which sets the minimum experience required for guides and trip leaders. Rangers have authority to inspect river logs for every guide, which must include a minimum of 50 hours on the water.</p>
			<p>Newly hired guides must have navigated the same stretch of the river at least once before they are allowed to take paying customers.</p>
			<p>State regulations also stipulate that every passenger must wear a life vest and that the raft contain rope, a first-aid kit, a patch-repair kit, drinking water or water-purification system, and human-waste containers. Outfitters must report an injury or death immediately to local authorities, although this often is not possible because reception is spotty in river canyons and remote stretches. In reality, amid the chaos of a flipped or high-sided raft, with customers floating in the river, the 911 call often is made by nearby rock climbers on a canyon wall, the next commercial float trip to come by that gets reception downstream or a motorist flagged down on a highway.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have to be skilled enough to take care of them,&rdquo; said David Costlow with the Colorado River Outfitters Association. &ldquo;Not sit back and call 911.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>River guides are typically the ones who cut open their client&rsquo;s wetsuit with a knife and start CPR on the riverbank. Response time by authorities is often 30 minutes or more, according to accident reports.</p>
			<p>Costlow said Colorado&rsquo;s regulations are among the most stringent in the country and were written at outfitters&rsquo; request to distinguish them from fly-by-night guides who set up shop for the season. Guides turning away people who don&rsquo;t look fit but say they are ready to float will &ldquo;be accused of sexism, racism, any kind of &lsquo;ism&rsquo; you can think of,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;If you tame it down too much, they are not coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At what point do people say, &lsquo;The fun&rsquo;s over. I&rsquo;ll put on the virtual reality goggles?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
			<p>But victims of rafting accidents said the regulations are too lax and that tourists might not realize how long it can take for medical help to arrive should something go wrong.</p>
			<p>Jenny Martin traveled from Texas last summer with a group of mothers and their 13-year-old daughters for the girls&rsquo; soccer tournament in Colorado. They booked a rafting trip down Clear Creek and realized within minutes of getting on the river that the Class IV-rated trip was &ldquo;more than we expected,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>
			<p>With the moms in one raft, and a group of 13-year-old girls in another, the moms and their guide were tossed into the water when their boat high-sided on an exposed rock. Michelle Math, Martin&rsquo;s best friend and the mother of her daughter&rsquo;s best friend, screamed as she floated downstream. The 13-year-old girls, including Math&rsquo;s daughter, were able to grab her life vest and hold onto her as they floated through whitewater, but they weren&rsquo;t strong enough to pull Math into their raft.</p>
			<p>The girls let go when a kayaker told them he would ferry Math to shore, but by the time the Texas mother reached the riverbank, she was unconscious. A guide started CPR, but Martin, who is a nurse, said the guide was not doing it correctly so she took over to try to save her friend&rsquo;s life.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I told her, &lsquo;You are not doing it right!,&rsquo; &rdquo; Martin recalled, saying the guide was using a compression-to-breath ratio that had been outdated for years. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big deal. It&rsquo;s my biggest thing that I&rsquo;m still very, very angry about.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It took 10 to 15 minutes for a kayaker to cross the river, climb up a cliff and flag down a car so the driver could call 911, Martin said.</p>
			<p>Martin never plans to raft again. But anyone who does, she said, should ask whether their guides are properly trained in CPR and whether they have phone communication and medical equipment to electronically shock someone&rsquo;s heart. She also suggested rafting customers make sure their boat is balanced &mdash; their raft had the &ldquo;three heaviest people on one side and the three smaller moms on the other,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Martin had to tell her best friend&rsquo;s daughter that her mother was dead after attempts to save her beside Clear Creek failed.</p>
			<p>Martin&rsquo;s daughter, who had held Math&rsquo;s life vest until handing her over to the kayaker, still has nightmares. &ldquo;She feels like she let her best friend down,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>
			<p>Jennifer Lenze and Paul Sizemore were on a &ldquo;babymoon&rdquo; in Aspen two years ago when Sizemore drowned on a guided trip along the Roaring Fork. Lenze and two other women pulled Sizemore back into the raft after a short but violent swim through serious whitewater. Guides started CPR.</p>
			<p>To get help, a fellow passenger had to climb up a steep embankment to a bike path and ask a cyclist to call 911. Lenze was screaming, asking why there was no helicopter or ambulance. &ldquo;It felt like an eternity,&rdquo; she said this week on the second anniversary of Sizemore&rsquo;s death. They had two sons together, now 2 and 4, and six kids between them.</p>
			<p>The state&rsquo;s accident report says Sizemore did not listen to guide commands or swim to shore after he went overboard. &ldquo;The report is absurd,&rdquo; Lenze said. &ldquo;They are blaming him, like he wasn&rsquo;t swimming hard enough to save his life?&rdquo; Sizemore, who ran marathons and lifted weights every other day, was the &ldquo;most fit man&rdquo; Lenze knew, she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s surreal still,&rdquo; Lenze said. &ldquo;Every day I think, &lsquo;if only we had not gone.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s hard to live that way.&rdquo;</p>

				<h4>Kenneth Barkley</h4>
				<p><strong>Lower Beaver Falls, Clear Creek</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">June 7, 2014<br />
				Highside Adventures<br />
				Rapids: Class III-IV<br />
				Water flow: high, 950-975 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>The final stretch of the Highside Adventures trip over violent class III and IV rapids was wild, with two passenger dumps in the span of a few river bends. The second time Kenneth Barkley, 43, of Brighton, went overboard, he did not survive.</p>
				<p>Just through Lower Beaver Falls, the raft Barkley rode in struck a bridge support head on, despite the crew&rsquo;s frantic back paddling. The nose of the raft hit the concrete. The raft turned sideways and instantly flipped, the bottom of the boat now along the bridge support. &ldquo;Highside left!&rdquo; the guide had shouted, trying to prevent the flip. But as the boat wrapped around the bridge support, all eight passengers, including the guide, were dumped into the 40-degree water.</p>
				<p>The crumpling raft and the ensuing chaos in June 2014 were captured by a passenger&rsquo;s GoPro helmet camera and posted on YouTube. Most of the eight passengers were able to swim to shore. One grabbed a tree limb and waited for a guide. Another was pulled into a boat as she floated downstream.</p>
				<p>With everyone back in the raft, and the boat heading downstream toward more rapids, the passengers were celebrating &mdash; and ignoring paddle commands. Without paddlers, the raft was spinning when it went, backward, over the top of a barely submerged rock.</p>
				<p>The jolt of the rock knocked Barkley off balance and out of the back of the raft.</p>
				<p>As the boat continued over several more rocks, every passenger but one fell into the river.</p>
				<p>Barkley floated downstream on his back, head downstream. The guide of his boat, 24-year-old John Myre, tried to reach out a paddle, but Barkley wasn&rsquo;t close enough to grab it. The guide said he motioned for Barkley to swim toward shore, but he continued to float on his back, arms outstretched. Two other passengers told park rangers they saw Barkley try to swim but he seemed exhausted.</p>
				<p>With the rest of the passengers and the boat on shore, Myre ran downstream to try to catch up to Barkley, who had far outpaced his raft, trying to reach him before he floated through Class V expert-level rapids downstream. Two other guides joined the search down the river, one driving Barkley&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s car.</p>
				<p>They saw him two or three times more, once without a life jacket, and always floating, making no attempt to swim.</p>
				<p>Barkley&rsquo;s body was found about a half-hour later, near U.S.&nbsp;6, about 7&nbsp;miles from where he fell overboard.</p>

				Rapds: Class IV<br />
				Water flow: 640-850 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>Chun Yip &ldquo;Daniel&rdquo; Cheong, 21, and his friends were visiting Colorado from Wichita, Kan., for the Fourth of July weekend last summer when they rafted Clear Creek. They chose a trip with expert-level rapids, Class IV and V, a decision Cheong&rsquo;s friend Weng Hing later called a mistake.</p>
				<p>The friends &ldquo;understood the difficulty level&rdquo; but &ldquo;underestimated the danger,&rdquo; Hing told a state parks investigator.</p>
				<p>As they headed into Double Knife Rapid, their raft clipped a rock wall on the left side of the rapid. &ldquo;Get down,&rdquo; shouted 43-year-old guide Ryan Wiese. Upon impact, three of the five passengers fell overboard.</p>
				<p>Two began swimming to shore, but Cheong was floating with his arms outstretched. The river tossed him through a rocky section called &ldquo;the reefs,&rdquo; and he slammed into exposed boulders.</p>
				<p>As another raft tried to reach Cheong, that boat hit a rock, and two passengers were knocked into the water. Both swam to shore. Cheong&rsquo;s guide tossed him a &ldquo;throw bag,&rdquo; and yelled, &ldquo;Grab the rope!&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;Turn over and swim!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>His friend Hing tried to grab him, but he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
				<p>Cheong was in the water three to five minutes before he was pulled into a raft and brought to shore, where guides ripped off his life jacket and started CPR. His face was blue. Guides shouted to nearby rock climbers to call 911, and help arrived within about seven minutes.</p>
				<p>Cheong&rsquo;s body was sent to Malaysia, with his family. Hing told the state investigator that &ldquo;maybe safety-wise, things could have been better.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;More boats in the water would have been better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;More people are around, you could get to another boat.&rdquo;</p>

				<h4>Ronald Palmer</h4>
				<p><strong>Horseshoe Rapid, Cache la Poudre River</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">July 7, 2015<br />
				A1 Wildwater<br />
				Rapids: Class III<br />
				Water flow: 858 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>It was a cloudy, chilly day for a river float when Ronald Palmer, 77, and six of his children and grandchildren rafted the Poudre River while vacationing in Colorado. The group of seven, who showed up at A1 Wildwater in Fort Collins last July in jeans and flannel shirts, was split into three groups for the float.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having the time of my life,&rdquo; Palmer told his family just minutes before he fell overboard.</p>
				<p>It was the California grandfather&rsquo;s first rafting trip, and the first for his grandchildren.</p>
				<p>They were about a mile in when the raft Palmer rode in hit a &ldquo;hole,&rdquo; a river feature where the water comes back on itself upstream. The impact and sudden change in momentum caused Palmer and two others to fall overboard. Their guide, 20-year-old Alex Owens, shouted to the three swimmers, &ldquo;Swim back to us!&rdquo; and paddled the raft toward them. Two were back in the raft within 15 seconds, but Palmer didn&rsquo;t try to swim and instead bobbed straight up and down.</p>
				<p>As the raft floated through Thunder Alley, a trio of rapids, so did Palmer. The raft would get near him, and then they would separate. The guide kept blowing his whistle, yelling at Palmer to swim. After several minutes, the guide got close enough to Palmer to pull him into the boat. He noticed then that Palmer&rsquo;s pants had fallen around his ankles, causing a drag and possibly preventing him from swimming.</p>
				<p>He was not responsive.</p>
				<p>On the bank of the river, one guide began CPR while another ran to the road, flagged down a car on Colorado&nbsp;14 and asked the driver to call 911 and send help. Palmer &ldquo;kinda blinked, and it looked like he tried to take a breath of air. And after that, there was nothing,&rdquo; a guide said later. They continued CPR for about 35 minutes until emergency responders arrived, but Palmer was not revived. The cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest because of&nbsp;&ldquo;environmental stress.&rdquo;</p>

				<h4>Eduardo Hernandez</h4>
				<p><strong>Three Rocks Rapid, Arkansas River</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">June 13, 2015<br />
				Whitewater Adventure Outfitters<br />
				Rapids: Class IV-V<br />
				Water flow: 4,400-5,410 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>On the hot day in June 2015 that Eduardo Hernandez died on the Arkansas River, 19 people in his five-raft float trip were tossed into the whitewater at the same time.</p>
				<p>The second boat to enter Three Rocks Rapid struck a large wave, dumping all of its passengers. The raft behind it &mdash; the one carrying 52-year-old Hernandez of Lakewood &mdash; flipped and spilled all of its passengers when it reached the frothy Class V wave. The fourth boat in Whitewater Adventure Outfitters&rsquo; chain struck the third and was held by the forces of a whitewater &ldquo;hole.&rdquo; All of its passengers washed out.</p>
				<p>All the boaters were recovered safely except Hernandez, whose lips were blue when a guide pulled him back into a raft.</p>
				<p>Two state parks rangers were on patrol along the Bighorn Sheep Canyon section of the Arkansas when they saw all the people in the river and two commercial rafts in pursuit trying to collect them. Officer Samuel Jordan launched his kayak and crossed the Arkansas to help, radioing for emergency responders. On shore, he tore off Hernandez&rsquo;s helmet and wetsuit to start CPR.</p>
				<p>Hernandez was not revived. His official cause of death, according to an autopsy, was drowning, complicated by obesity and an enlarged heart.</p>

				<h4>Chris Sevilla</h4>
				<p><strong>Squeeze Box in the Royal Gorge, Arkansas River</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">June 14, 2014<br />
				Raft Masters Inc.<br />
				Rapids: Class IV-V<br />
				Water flow: 2,970-3,200 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>The guide navigating the raft carrying Chris Sevilla down the Arkansas asked the Colorado Springs man several times whether he should continue with the whitewater trip as it got increasingly more hairy. Sevilla, 45, was worn out from zip lining the day before, his arms too tired to paddle. He was short of breath.</p>
				<p>At lunch that June 2014 day, Sevilla insisted he felt better and &ldquo;absolutely wanted to continue rafting,&rdquo; according to a state parks report on his death.</p>
				<p>As the boat entered the Royal Gorge, guide James Palmer, 43, had Sevilla sit in the middle of the raft so he could rest. In a section of the river called the Narrows, the raft was thrust by the Squeeze Box rapid into a sheer rock wall on the right side of the river.</p>
				<p>The raft began to capsize.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Highside!,&rdquo; yelled Palmer, trying to shift the weight distribution of the raft.</p>
				<p>They flipped.</p>
				<p>As another guide began pulling people into his boat, Palmer was able to flip his raft back over and grab onto Sevilla and the raft. But he lost his grip on both as the men entered the next rapid, Wall Slammer.</p>
				<p>Another guide, with the help of three passengers, pulled Sevilla into their boat. But he was not responsive, and his face was purple. By this time, the raft was hitting Boat Eater and Triple Drop rapids, and the guide couldn&rsquo;t pull to the side of the river and start CPR until they were through the whitewater.</p>
				<p>The nearest help came by train, along the Royal Gorge Railroad.</p>
				<p>Sevilla was loaded onto the train, where CPR continued until they connected with Freemont County emergency services in Ca&ntilde;on City. About an hour passed from the time of the accident until Sevilla reached Ca&ntilde;on City, where he died.</p>

				<h4>Van Hodges</h4>
				<p><strong>Three Rocks Rapid, Arkansas River</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">June 10, 2014<br />
				Royal Gorge Rafting<br />
				Rapids: Class IV<br />
				Water flow: 3,340 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>The safety speech along the banks of the Arkansas River covered everything. But a group of rafters visiting Colorado from Oklahoma didn&rsquo;t actually expect they would fall into the rushing, frigid whitewater.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand it was going to be that bad,&rdquo; Steve Leim of Stillwater would later tell a Colorado State Parks investigator. &ldquo;I did not think the boat was going to flip over.&rdquo; The group, he said, didn&rsquo;t understand &ldquo;the power of the water.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Van Hodges, 48, from Enid was on a half-day raft trip through the Bighorn Sheep Canyon section of the river the day he died. Five passengers, including Hodges, were tossed into the water when their raft hit the top of a rapid called Three Rocks. Their guide, Brian Botelho, 29, &nbsp;yelled and pointed toward the left side of the river, showing the people in the water they should swim left to avoid a whitewater &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in the middle of the river. Botelho paddled the same direction and began plucking people back into the boat.</p>
				<p>As the raft following Botelho&rsquo;s entered the rapid, its passengers &mdash; shocked at the sight of people in the water &mdash; stopped paddling. Their raft drifted sideways and into the hole, where it flipped and everyone fell out.</p>
				<p>Besides Hodges, the rest of the passengers were pulled into rafts or were able to swim to shore. Hodges, witnesses said, made no attempt to swim as a guide shouted to him to roll onto his stomach. A kayaker on the trip, there to help in case passengers fell into the river, told Hodges to grab his kayak.</p>
				<p>Instead, Hodges grabbed for the guide, something passengers were told not to do before the trip launched. The guide swatted Hodges&rsquo; hands away and again told him to hold onto the kayak. When Hodges did not respond, the guide grabbed the back of his life jacket and floated him toward shore.</p>
				<p>Some people in the same Oklahoma group had floated the Arkansas the prior summer and remembered the trip as &ldquo;too easy,&rdquo; Earl Madison, then 64, told state investigators. But they noticed as soon as they got on the water that deadly trip in 2014 that the waves were bigger, the water was faster.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Large waves came off a rock and knocked me over my friend and off the boat,&rdquo; Madison said. &ldquo;Chaos from there, swimming, guide yelling to swim, guide stuck out paddle and pulled me in.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>While he was in the water, Madison felt &ldquo;a lot of stress on the body&rdquo; and that his &ldquo;chest felt like it was going to cave in.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>A rotating team of people, including a raft passenger who was a nurse, administered CPR on Hodges for about 40 minutes. The official cause of death was drowning.</p>

				<h4>Mary Johnson</h4>
				<p><strong>Pine Creek Rapid, Arkansas River</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">July 24, 2014<br />
				Timberline Tours<br />
				Rapids: Class V<br />
				Water flow: 1,250 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>Mary Johnson, a 57-year-old woman from Dallas, had been rafting eight times before but never on a Class V rapid. And she&rsquo;d never fallen out of a raft.</p>
				<p>More than once, the Timberline Tours guide offered to let Mary and her husband, Ken, &ldquo;portage&rdquo; the most aggressive rapid on the trip &mdash; a Class V beast called Pine Creek &mdash; meaning they could walk the shoreline and get back in the raft after the rapid. But the couple, and everyone else on the two-raft trip that July 2014 day, chose to go through it.</p>
				<p>Two kayakers, on the trip to help in case anyone fell into the river, navigated Pine Creek Rapid first and were followed by the first raft. They waited 30 yards downstream, ready with a throw rope should the second raft, carrying the Johnsons, have any trouble.</p>
				<p>The Johnsons&rsquo; raft struck a rock, and their guide, Jason Connolly, 41, bounced out. He swam toward the raft and tried to climb back in. But before he could, the raft hit a hydraulic hole and began &ldquo;surfing&rdquo; &mdash; bouncing and spinning on top of the hole. The tug of the river dragged Connolly under the raft and downstream about 15 yards before he was able to swim to shore.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, the Johnsons and another man were thrown into the river as the raft surfed in place. The other passenger was sucked under the raft and spit out, able to swim to shore. The Johnsons floated downstream.</p>
				<p>When Connolly reached the shore, he ran back upstream to the raft and threw a rope to its remaining passengers, pulling the raft to shore. This took about five minutes, as the Johnsons were swept away in the whitewater.</p>
				<p>While Connolly was rescuing the raft, Ken Johnson had swum aggressively toward shore about 200 yards downstream and was able to grab a rope thrown by another guide.</p>
				<p>Photographs taken by a photographer positioned beside the river for action shots of the trip show Mary hitting several rocks as she was tossed downstream. One rock stopped her and submerged her before she washed through the Pine Creek Hole.</p>
				<p>When Mary resurfaced, conscious but distressed, she briefly grabbed the bow of a rescue kayak. But by then she was weak. She&nbsp;let go and was again washed downstream. The kayaker pursued her but wasn&rsquo;t able to push her to shore until after Triple Drop Rapid, where Mary bounced through more rocks and turbulent water. Her head was no longer above water, and she was unconscious after floating 650 yards down a steeply graded section of the Arkansas containing &ldquo;numerous powerful waves, holes and large boulders.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Guides began CPR as Connolly climbed up the river bank to U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;24, where he flagged down a motorist and used a cellphone to call 911.</p>
				<p>Connolly then found Ken Johnson and waited with him until Mary&rsquo;s body was evacuated by Chaffee County emergency services, which&nbsp;arrived about 35 minutes after she was pulled from&nbsp;the river. The cause of death was ruled as drowning.</p>
				<p>Ken would tell a state investigator that his memory of the events was limited, but he remembered being &ldquo;flipped out of the raft&rdquo; and feeling &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; when he grabbed the rope and reached the shore.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;When you do this, you don&rsquo;t think this is going to happen,&rdquo; he said.</p>

				Water flow: 350 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>Minutes before Erik Luna unexpectedly fell backward out of a raft into Clear Creek, a photographer on the riverbank took the perfect action shot: the family smiling and laughing in a spray of whitewater.</p>
				<p>Luna had just given his rafting guide a thumbs up, and then he was in the river. As the 36-year-old from Carlsbad, N.M., floated downstream, his wife shouted, &ldquo;He has asthma!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Rafting guide Shawn Stephens, 25, reached out a paddle, and Luna grabbed hold. But he wasn&rsquo;t able to keep his grip. Luna, who was on the rafting trip with five relatives, floated downstream through Dizzy Lizzy, a Class III rapid.</p>
				<p>The raft knocked into a rock, and then 13-year-old Deric Luna was nearly tossed into the river, injuring his knee. The guide was able to quickly pull him back into the boat before he fell out completely.</p>
				<p>As the raft chased Erik Luna down the river, his relatives were panicking and had stopped listening to paddling commands, according to the Parks and Wildlife&nbsp;report. Stephens navigated his raft to shore then threw a rescue rope at Luna.</p>
				<p>But by this point, Luna was &ldquo;unconscious and face down in the water,&rdquo; according to the report.</p>
				<p>Stephens left his passengers on shore and hopped in the other raft on the trip as it chased Luna through Powerline Rapid. The guide reached Luna and brought him to shore, where he began CPR. The trip photographer, meanwhile, called 911 when she realized a passenger was face down and an unconscious in the water.</p>
				<p>Guides were unable to help Luna resume breathing. His death and the injury to Deric Luna&rsquo;s knee were &ldquo;consistent with inherent injuries and scenarios that can take place in Class III whitewater,&rdquo; according to the state parks report.</p>

				<p>What was supposed to be a fun family adventure turned deadly at Corner Pocket in&nbsp;June 2015.</p>
				<p>Jose Soto, 57, of Farmington, N.M., and three of his family members went overboard as their 24-year-old Mild to Wild raft guide entered the Class IV rapid off line and sideways.

By the time he was pulled into a boat, Soto was unconscious and not responsive. He had no pulse when guides started CPR.</p>
				<p>Soto was described by one of the guides as &ldquo;very jolly&rdquo; and the &ldquo;biggest person I could pull into a raft, but not bigger than the equipment.&rdquo; Some of his family had floated the same stretch of the Animas, but the river wasn&rsquo;t as high as it was last June.</p>

				<p><strong>Double Knife Rapid, Clear Creek</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">May 22, 2015<br />
				All American Adventures<br />
				Rapids: Class IV<br />
				Water flow: 350-620 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>Michelle Math, a 48-year-old mother from Wylie, Texas, &nbsp;was &ldquo;mildly nervous&rdquo; as she put on a wetsuit, high-top booties and a helmet for her first whitewater rafting trip last May, according to a Parks and Wildlife investigation.</p>
				<p>Math and her 13-year-old daughter were with a group of mothers and daughters who traveled to Colorado for the girls&rsquo; soccer tournament. Moms were in one raft, and most of the girls were in another.</p>
				<p>Math and another woman who was also nervous sat just in front of their rafting guide in the &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; boat, the last raft in line on an early-season, chilly trip down Clear Creek.</p>
				<p>After the accident, multiple passengers told a state investigator the raft carrying Math was &ldquo;very off balance,&rdquo; making it hard to navigate, and that they had complained about this to the guide. The three largest women were on one side of the boat, while the three smallest were on the other. One woman &ldquo;said that rafting companies need to tell people the dangers associated with rafting and that she was shocked it could end in death.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>As guide Kyle Kenefick, 29, entered Double Knife Rapid, his raft veered too far to the right, and he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t get it back over,&rdquo; according to the state report. The raft bumped a rock and tipped left, tossing Math, the guide and four other passengers into the river.</p>
				<p>When a state investigator asked Kenefick what factors caused the raft to go too far right, he &ldquo;said he didn&rsquo;t have a good reason why and that he preferred not to answer that question,&rdquo; according to the report.</p>
				<p>Kenefick was able to grab the raft and hop back in soon after he was thrown overboard, then he pulled three passengers back into the boat. Math and another passenger floated downstream. His crew, now &ldquo;scared and panicking,&rdquo; were no longer working as a team as Kenefick chased his lost passengers down the creek. In a rapid called Hell&rsquo;s Corner, the raft got hung up on a rock and half the crew lost their paddles, delaying their rescue attempt.</p>
				<p>As Math floated, her life jacket was riding high, a common issue &ldquo;particularly on overweight people,&rdquo; the state report noted. She was screaming.</p>
				<p>A second raft on the trip, carrying Math&rsquo;s daughter, also was chasing her down the creek. Math&rsquo;s daughter, two other teenagers and the petite raft guide in that boat grabbed Math&rsquo;s life jacket but were not able to pull her into the raft. Instead, they tried to keep her head above water as they tore through Hell&rsquo;s Corner.</p>
				<p>Eventually, Math was pulled to shore by two kayakers from another float trip at the Terminator 2 rapid. She had no pulse, and CPR compressions did not revive her. She was pronounced dead by emergency responders along the bank of the river. Cause of death was drowning.</p>
				<p>The state report noted the rafting company did not record customers&rsquo; medical conditions and had a policy that &ldquo;if a customer can&rsquo;t fit in a life jacket, they&rsquo;re not allowed on the trip.&rdquo; All American Adventures did not have a formal emergency action plan, besides using a cellphone to call 911.</p>
				<p>The investigation found no violation of state law despite &ldquo;allegations of the raft being improperly loaded,&rdquo; the report said.</p>

				<h4>Paul Sizemore</h4>
				<p><strong>Hell&rsquo;s Half Mile, Slaughterhouse section of the Roaring Fork River</strong></p>
				<p class="slideshow-intro">June 16, 2014<br />
				Blazing Adventures<br />
				Rapids: Class IV<br />
				Water flow: 1,300 cubic feet per second</p>
				<p>Paul Sizemore and his&nbsp;significant other, Jennifer Lenze, were on a belated &ldquo;babymoon&rdquo; in Aspen after the birth of their second child when they saw a rafting video while checking in at the&nbsp;Ritz hotel.</p>
				<p>They thought they were both up for a Class IV trip down the Roaring Fork, though Lenze&nbsp;was nervous as they signed waivers on the bus ride to the river. Sizemore, 44, was &ldquo;the most fit man I&rsquo;ve ever known,&rdquo; Lenze said in an interview this week, on the two-year anniversary of his death. He ran marathons and long-distance&nbsp;relays.</p>
				<p>The two rafts and a safety kayaker ran the first major rapid with no trouble then pulled on shore to rest, drink water and talk about the upcoming rapid, Hell&rsquo;s Half Mile.</p>
				<p>When they started their next difficult run, the raft carrying Sizemore and Lenz stalled after going over the second ledge in a steep section of frothy whitewater. The boat momentarily &ldquo;surfed,&rdquo; held in place by the hydraulic hole. The raft turned left, and Sizemore and another man tumbled into the river.</p>
				<p>Guide Michael Lewis, 42, extended his paddle to Sizemore so he could grab on, but both passengers were swept downstream.</p>
				<p>Instead of swimming toward shore, Sizemore was looking to a guide in the safety kayak for help, the investigative report says. They weren&rsquo;t able to reach each other because of the turbulent and steep shoot of the river. The guide in the other raft tossed Sizemore a rope, but he didn&rsquo;t catch it.</p>
				<p>Soon after, the three women in Lewis&rsquo; raft &mdash; including Lenze &mdash; were able to pull Sizemore back into the boat. He was &ldquo;talking and awake&rdquo; at first, but then his &ldquo;eyes rolled back,&rdquo; according to a Parks and Wildlife&nbsp;report.</p>
				<p>Guides began CPR in the raft and moved Sizemore to shore. Lenze was &ldquo;hysterical,&rdquo; according to the report. Someone walked her upstream, away from Sizemore, to try to calm her down. Lenze says she was screaming for help, wondering why no helicopter or ambulance had arrived. Aspen firefighters, securing Sizemore in a litter attached to a rope, pulled him out of the river canyon to a bike path above, as CPR continued.</p>
				<p>Sizemore died after being in the river for an estimated two and a half minutes, a &ldquo;short but violent swim,&rdquo; according to the state report.</p>
				<p>When the water flow in this section of the river is 1,800 cubic feet per second &mdash; 500 cfs higher than it was the June 2014 day Sizemore died &mdash; Blazing Adventures takes only those 18 and older. It does not require customers to have whitewater experience.</p>
